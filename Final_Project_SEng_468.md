What You’re Building

You will create a distributed semantic search system where: 1. Users can sign up and log in (authentication required) 2. Users can upload PDF documents (personal document library) 3. Users can search across their PDFs using natural language queries 4. System returns the top 5 most relevant paragraphs with relevance scores 5. System handles concurrent users uploading and searching simultaneously 6. Everything runs via Docker Compose (single command deployment)

1.1

What This Is NOT

- NOT a RAG system (no LLM-generated answers, just retrieval)
- NOT a keyword search (use semantic embeddings, not regex/SQL LIKE)
- NOT about UI beauty (simple functional UI is fine, focus on backend)

1.2

Example User Flow

1. Alice signs up and logs in 2. Alice uploads 3 research papers (PDFs) 3. Alice searches: ”machine learning optimization techniques” 4. System returns 5 paragraphs sorted by relevance score:
- Paragraph from Paper 1 (score: 0.89)
- Paragraph from Paper 3 (score: 0.82)
- Paragraph from Paper 2 (score: 0.78)
- ...

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate mastery of scalability concepts. Depending on your design choices, you may demonstrate:
- Asynchronous processing (decoupling heavy tasks from API responses)
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Redis Queue, or equivalent)
- Caching strategies (Redis or equivalent for performance optimization)
- Object storage (MinIO for stateless file handling)
- Vector databases (ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus, pgvector, Elasticsearch, FAISS, OpenSearch)

- Semantic embeddings (sentence-transformers or equivalent local models)
- Horizontal scalability (stateless design, load balancing, database sharding)
- Database optimization (indexing, query optimization, connection pooling)
- Performance testing (Locust, k6, or equivalent)
- Docker Compose orchestration (multi-container deployment)
- Professional Git workflow (feature branches, pull requests, code reviews)
Note: The technologies and patterns you implement depend on your architectural decisions. What matters is that your system scales horizontally and handles concurrent load effectively.

Technical Requirements

3.1

Core Functionality Requirements

Your system MUST implement the following: 1. User Authentication
- Sign up (username + password)
- Login (returns token: JWT or session ID)
- All document operations require authentication
2. PDF Management
- Upload PDFs (multipart/form-data)
- List user’s uploaded PDFs
- Delete PDFs (removes file and all vector data)
- PDFs are user-specific (Alice cannot see Bob’s PDFs)
3. Semantic Search
- Search across user’s PDFs using natural language
- Return top 5 most relevant paragraphs
- Each result includes: paragraph text, relevance score, source document ID
- Results sorted by relevance (highest first)
4. Asynchronous Processing
- PDF upload returns immediately (does not wait for processing)
- PDF parsing and embedding generation happen in background
- Use message queue or task queue pattern

3.2

Technology Guidance (Not Requirements)

You have full autonomy in technology choices. However, here are suggestions based on scalability best practices: Suggested Technologies & Why:
- MinIO for PDF Storage
  - Note: I recommend further research about object storages like MinIO as this is
not covered in lectures
  - S3-compatible object storage
  - Keeps your API tier stateless (no local file storage)
  - Enables horizontal scaling (multiple API instances can access same storage)
  - Industry standard for microservices architecture
- Vector Database for Embeddings
  - Options: ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus, pgvector, Elasticsearch, FAISS, OpenSearch
  - Optimized for similarity search (cosine similarity, dot product)
  - Much faster than computing distances for every paragraph
  - Essential for semantic search at scale
- Message Queue for Async Processing
  - RabbitMQ (covered in Lab 7) or Redis Queue
  - Decouples API from CPU-intensive PDF processing
  - Allows multiple worker processes
  - Prevents API timeouts on large PDFs
- Embedding Models (Local Only)
  - sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - Any local transformer library that produces vector embeddings
  - Do not use API-based models (e.g., OpenAI) - we need to stress test without
cost concerns
  - Model must run locally in your Docker environment
Key Point: Whatever technology stack you choose, if it is backed by reasoning and logic and works at scale horizontally, it works for us. Justify your choices in your report.

API Specification (Port 8080) CRITICAL: All systems MUST expose these exact endpoints on Port 8080. TAs will use automated scripts to test your API. Non-compliance will result in test failures and point deductions.

4.1

Authentication Endpoints

### `POST /auth/signup` Create a new user account Request:

{

" username ": " alice " , " password ": " se curepa ssword 123 "

}

# 1 {

{

{

### `POST /auth/login` Authenticate and receive token Request:

" username ": " alice " , " password ": " se curepa ssword 123 " }

# 1 {

Response (200 OK):

" token ": " e y J h b G c i O i J I U z I 1 N i I s I n R 5 c C I 6 I k p X V C J 9 ..." , " user_id ": " uuid - or - integer "

}

Bearer <token>

]

Important:
- Always return exactly 5 results (or fewer if less than 5 paragraphs exist)
- Results must be sorted by score (highest first)
- Scores should be between 0.0 and 1.0 (cosine similarity, dot product, etc.)

- Only search user’s own documents

System Architecture Guidelines

5.1

Required Architecture Patterns

Your system must address these scalability challenges: 1. Stateless API Tier
- API servers should not store files locally
- Session state in database or Redis (not in-memory)
- Multiple API instances should work identically
2. Decoupled Background Processing
- PDF upload endpoint returns immediately (202 Accepted)
- Parsing, chunking, and embedding generation happen asynchronously
- Use message queue or task queue (RabbitMQ, Celery, Redis Queue)
- Worker processes can scale independently from API
3. Persistent Storage Strategy
- PDFs: Object storage (MinIO recommended)
- User data: Relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Vector embeddings: Vector database (ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus, pgvector)
- Session/auth tokens: Database or Redis
4. Concurrent Request Handling
- System must handle multiple users uploading PDFs simultaneously
- Searches must not block uploads or other searches
- No race conditions (e.g., two users uploading same filename)
- Important: Consider the case where a single user has two active sessions logged in
simultaneously - race conditions on files or database records must be handled properly

5.2

Example Architecture Diagram

Your report must include a detailed architecture diagram. Here’s a simplified example:

Browser (UI)

API (Flask)

MinIO (PDF Storage)

PostgreSQL (Users, Metadata)

RabbitMQ (Message Queue)

Worker (Celery Worker)

ChromaDB (Embeddings)

IMPORTANT: This is just one possible random design example with no specific reasoning behind it. Your architecture will likely differ significantly. This is shown only to illustrate what an architecture diagram looks like. Design your own system based on your requirements and justify every choice in your report.

Performance Evaluation

6.1

Load Testing Requirements

Your system will be stress tested by TAs on UVic cluster hardware. Tests will include: 1. Concurrent Uploads
- Multiple users uploading PDFs simultaneously
- PDF sizes: 1MB - 50MB
- Endpoint must return 202 quickly (target: < 500ms)
2. Concurrent Searches
- Multiple users searching simultaneously
- Search endpoint latency (target: P95 < 2 seconds)
- System should not crash or timeout
3. Mixed Workload
- Some users uploading, others searching
- System should remain responsive
- No request failures due to resource exhaustion

6.2

What You Must Report

In your video and report, demonstrate:
- Hardware specifications you tested on (CPU, RAM, disk)
- Load testing tool used (Locust, k6, Apache Bench, etc.)
- Performance metrics:
  - Throughput (requests per second)
  - Latency (mean, P50, P95, P99)
  - Maximum concurrent users handled
  - Point of failure (if system crashes, when and why?)
- Bottleneck analysis:
  - What was the bottleneck? (CPU, memory, database, vector search?)
  - How did you identify it? (profiling, monitoring)
  - What optimizations did you implement?
  - Before/after performance comparisons
Pro Tip: Start load testing early! Don’t wait until the last week. Finding bottlenecks takes time, and fixing them takes even longer.

Deliverables

7.1

Docker Compose (Mandatory)

- Single docker-compose.yml file
- Must start entire system with: docker-compose up
- All services must be containerized (API, worker, databases, MinIO, etc.)
- Must work on any machine (no hardcoded paths, no local dependencies)
- Include .env.example file with all required environment variables
- Include README.md with setup instructions
TAs will test your system by: 1. git clone <your-repo> 2. cp .env.example .env 3. docker-compose up 4. Running automated API tests against http://localhost:8080 If this doesn’t work, you will lose significant points.

7.2

Technical Report (Mandatory Prerequisite)

IMPORTANT: The report is mandatory but not graded separately. However, TAs will use your report to evaluate your Design & Implementation (40%). Without a report, we cannot grade your design decisions, and you will receive 0/40 for Design & Implementation. Report Requirements:
- Format: PDF only
- Template: Word document template will be provided
- Length: As needed to cover all required content (avoid unnecessary verbosity)
- Must be concise, technical, and well-organized
- Must include:

just what)
  - Technology stack justification (backed by research and logic)
  - Scalability analysis (how your system scales horizontally)
  - Bottleneck identification and solutions (profiling evidence, before/after metrics)
  - Performance testing methodology (what tools, what scenarios)
  - Performance results (actual numbers: throughput, latency, graphs)
  - Hardware specifications (what you tested on)
  - Load testing graphs and analysis (visual evidence of performance)
  - Team collaboration workflow (how you worked together)
  - Git workflow explanation (branching strategy, code review process)
  - AI usage disclosure (if applicable - see AI policy section)
  - Challenges encountered and solutions (technical depth, problem-solving)
Report Writing Guidelines:
- Be concise and technical - Avoid long, verbose, AI-generated content
- Use diagrams, tables, and graphs - Not walls of text
- Include actual numbers and metrics - Vague descriptions will not receive credit
- Explain why you made decisions - Not just what you did
- Show engineering depth and critical thinking - We want to see your reasoning
- Avoid fluff and padding - Quality over quantity
- Cite all sources - Including AI tools (see AI policy)

What We’re Looking For:
- Deep understanding of scalability principles
- Evidence-based decision making
- Professional technical writing

# 5 perf : optimize vector search with batch processing

Bad commit messages:

# 1 Update

# 2 Fixed stuff

# 3 WIP

# 4 asdfasdf

# 5 final version ( there should be no " final version " in git !)

10.5

What NOT to Commit

Important: Focus on quality and completeness of content, not page count. Include all required sections with sufficient detail to demonstrate your engineering depth and decision-making process.

AI Usage Policy

12.1

AI Tools Are Allowed With Disclosure

You are permitted to use AI tools such as:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, other LLMs
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor, other code assistants
- Code completion and suggestion tools

12.2

Core Principle: You Control AI, Not Vice Versa

Use AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement for Your Engineering Judgment
- AI should facilitate your work - help you learn, search, debug, write faster
- AI should not think for you - you must understand every line of code and every design
decision
- You are engineers under evaluation, not AI output reviewers
- Use AI supervised under your control, not blindly following suggestions
- This project is for your assessment and learning - it should fundamentally be your
work

12.3

Mandatory Disclosure

You MUST clearly cite all AI contributions in your report. Include: 1. Which AI tools you used (specific names and versions) 2. What you used them for specifically:
- Code generation (which parts?)
- Debugging (which issues?)
- Research and learning (which topics?)
- Report writing (which sections?)
- Architecture suggestions (which decisions?)
3. Approximate percentage of work done by AI vs. your own work 4. Examples of AI-generated code that you reviewed and modified 5. Evidence that you understand all AI-generated code 6. How you verified AI suggestions were correct Failure to disclose AI usage is academic misconduct and will result in 0 for the project.

12.4

Understanding Is Required

- You must fully understand all code in your project, regardless of source
- TAs may ask you to explain any part of your code during evaluation
- If you cannot explain code in your submission, you will lose substantial points
- AI-generated code must be reviewed, tested, understood, and often modified by you
- Blindly copying AI output without understanding shows lack of engineering competence

12.5

Acceptable vs. Unacceptable AI Use

Acceptable Use:
- Using AI to learn about vector databases you haven’t seen before
- Asking AI to explain error messages and suggest debugging approaches
- Using AI to generate boilerplate code that you then customize
- Using AI to review your architecture and suggest improvements
- Using AI to help format and structure your report
- Using AI as a ”rubber duck” to discuss design trade-offs

Unacceptable Use:
- Asking AI to generate entire project and submitting with minimal changes
- Copying AI-generated code without understanding how it works
- Letting AI make all architectural decisions without your engineering judgment
- Submitting AI-written report sections verbatim without editing
- Using AI to write your video script word-for-word
- Not disclosing AI usage at all
- Claiming AI-generated work as entirely your own
Best Practice: Think of AI as an experienced colleague you can consult, not as someone who does your work for you. The best projects will show clear evidence of your own engineering judgment, critical thinking, and problem-solving - not just AI output. Use AI to learn faster and work more efficiently, but make sure the fundamental ideas, decisions, and implementations are yours.

Tips for Success

13.1

Start Early

- Don’t wait until the checkpoint to start
- Docker setup alone can take hours
- Integrating multiple services is complex
- Load testing and optimization take the most time

13.2

Incremental Development

Build in this order: 1. Basic API with authentication (no PDFs yet) 2. Simple PDF upload (save locally first, MinIO later) 3. PDF parsing and chunking (start with simple logic) 4. Embedding generation (test with small PDFs) 5. Vector storage and search (start with simple vector DB) 6. Asynchronous processing (add queue last) 7. Load testing and optimization

13.3

Test Locally First

- Test each component separately before integration
- Use small test PDFs (1-2 pages)
- Test Docker Compose early (don’t leave it to the end)
- Test on a fresh machine (ask a friend to run your Docker Compose)

13.4

Communication

- Meet with your partner regularly (at least twice a week)
- Use GitHub Issues or Trello for task tracking
- Document decisions in commit messages or README
- Ask TAs or instructor if you’re stuck (don’t waste days debugging)

13.5

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Hardcoding paths: Use environment variables
- Ignoring Docker: Test Docker Compose from day 1
- Skipping load testing: Start load testing by Week 3
- Oversized commits: Commit frequently with clear messages
- No documentation: Document as you go, not at the end
- Last-minute report: Start report outline early

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do we need a UI? A: No, UI is not graded. A simple UI is recommended for the demo video, but TAs will test via API only. Q: Can we use [technology X] instead of MinIO/RabbitMQ/etc.? A: Yes! Technology choices are yours. Just justify them in your report. Q: What if our vector database doesn’t scale well? A: That’s OK. Document the bottleneck in your report, explain what you tried, and discuss what you would do differently with more time/resources. Q: How many PDFs should our system handle? A: There’s no fixed number. Test with what your hardware can handle. Document your system’s limits and explain the bottlenecks. Q: Can we use cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure)? A: No. Everything must run via Docker Compose locally. This ensures fair testing for all teams.

Q: What if we miss the checkpoint? A: You lose 15% of your grade. No extensions except for documented emergencies. Q: Can we use pre-trained embedding models? A: Yes! Use sentence-transformers, OpenAI, or any embedding model. Just document your choice. Q: How do we handle large PDFs (100+ pages)? A: Implement chunking (split into paragraphs or fixed-size chunks). Document your chunking strategy. Q: What if Docker Compose doesn’t work on the TA’s machine? A: You will lose significant points. Test on multiple machines before submitting.
